            <h1>So you think your website is doing great</h1>
<p>Most websites are far from perfect. There are so many things that could go wrong or simply be forgotten.</p>
<p>If you're not a web professional, you might not care. What you don't know can't hurt you, right? Of course, that is not the case. Instead, you should hire a professional web developer who can help elevate your online presence and assist you in growing your business.</p>
<p>Your website presence is all about technical correctness and traffic. While traffic cannot always be controlled, technical details can always be improved and optimized.</p>
<p>Let's say your website has HTML errors. While browsers can be forgiving and display the website (almost) correctly, other tools can penalize you. Sometimes, even valid but poorly structured HTML code can hurt your scores. For example, Google might struggle to crawl your site if there are errors that are too severe or if your site does not use semantic tags.</p>
<p>Broken JavaScript won't just hurt your scores — it will stop your site from working correctly. Too much JavaScript might slow your site, and you will be penalized because your PageSpeed scores will be too low.</p>
<p>Bloated CSS might slow the rendering of your site, which might cause layout shifts and styling bugs that are hard to debug and fix.</p>
<p>You might not know how to add OG images or structured data, causing you to miss out on nice search page result features.</p>
<p>Don't get us started on website security, which most people take for granted these days. Websites get hacked daily.</p>
<p>So. Many. Things.</p>
<p>There are so many things that you might never have heard of, but they can help you establish a better presence for you and your business online. A better presence than your competitors. A better presence that will attract more visitors. A better presence that will generate more leads. A better presence that will increase your revenue.</p>
<p>It is worth the investment to find a reliable web developer to handle all of these things for you.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on this blog, as we plan to write more about developing a successful website from our own human perspective and experience.</p>
