            My partner and I teamed up with Silvestar this year to bring our new company’s website to life, based on some design sketches I had. The work he did for us was top-notch.
          full: |
            Throughout the process, we felt in good hands with his expertise and his readiness to go the extra mile to guide us through the different steps.

            It’s worth mentioning that he was super quick in getting the job done and was really accommodating with our requests. The whole experience was smooth and enjoyable. We’re looking forward to the next chance to work with him!

          summary: |
            Silvestar has been our web developer at Wunder Mobility for the past year. In that time, I’ve found him to be diligent, highly talented, hard working, collaborative and self-motivated.

          full: |
            When Silvestar took over our domain, it had multiple technical issues and was on an outdated CMS. He quickly made progress and improved our technical set up making iterative gains each week. At the same time, he worked together with our Creative team to improve the design of the website. He was able to not only collaborate with designers but had synergy and helped improve the overall UI and UX.

            Silvestar is a thought-leader in web development, and his work reflects it. His knowledge goes beyond development of websites and extends into areas like technical SEO and backend development. He assisted on Google Ads and CRM connection projects that were vital to our success.

            Silvestar is a great developer to work with, and I recommend him to any Marketing team.

        quote:
          summary: |
            I've been working closely with Silvestar for about 2 years now, managing and designing the website project that he's in charge of developing. It has clearly been the most seamless and enriching developer-designer collaboration I've had so far.
          full: |
            His work transformed our website from a poorly built, difficult-to-maintain draft into a high-performance, scalable site that will serve us well for years to come. Silvestar has worked with us on finding the best possible software and code solutions for each part of the website's infrastructure, and has implemented them all himself, incl. the complete CMS setup in a highly editor-friendly way. Since then, I've had the pleasure to bring over 40 new pages to life with his help.

            What I like particularly is Silvestar's eagerness to find straightforward solutions for our needs with the lowest amount of code necessary, rather than relying on third-party tools that would just clutter things up and lead to bad performance. That being said, he even optimized some of our landing pages to achieve a perfect 100% score across all PageSpeed Insights categories – something I’ve never seen before. It's all thanks to his constant hard work of iterating on all ends of the code until perfection.

            I highly recommend Silvestar to any marketing team in need of a skilled, diligent freelancer who delivers robust and scalable web solutions. I've learned so much from our collaboration and I'm looking forward to continuing it.
